Steps needed to build JGraLab:

1. Unzip the zip-file to any directory.

2. Download jdom, antlr, javaee and xmlrpc, and copy the nessesary jar-files to these locations:
	- jdom to common/lib/jdom
	- antlr to common/lib/antlr
	- javaee to common/lib/javaee
	- xmlrpc to jgralab/lib/xmlrpc (more than one jar-file)
   
   jdom can be downloaded from:
   		http://www.jdom.org/
   
   antlr can be downloaded from:
   		http://www.antlr.org/
   
   javaee (Java Enterprise Edition) can be downloaded from:
   		http://java.sun.com
   	The needed file is called javaee.jar
   
   xmlrpc can be downloaded from:
   		http://www.xmlrpc.com/

3. If not present, download and install apache ant:
		http://ant.apache.org/

4. Open up a console and navigate to the directory you unziped the files. Then type the following commands:
	cd jgralab
	ant

5. The jar-file of jgralab is located at jgralab/build/jar .
   It includes all jar-files, except javaee.jar. If you need it (xmlrpc is the only part of JGraLab that
   needs this file), you have to add it to the classpath manually.
