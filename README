Steps needed to build JGraLab:

1. Unzip the zip-file to any directory.

2. Download jdom, and copy the nessesary jar-files to
   these locations:

    - jdom to common/lib/jdom
   
   jdom can be downloaded from:
        http://www.jdom.org/
   
3. If not present, download and install apache ant:
        http://ant.apache.org/

4. Open up a console and navigate to the directory you unzipped the files.
   Then type the following commands:

     cd jgralab
     ant

   To get backtraces with line numbers on exceptions, build it with the debug
   property set to true, i.e.

     ant -Ddebug=true

5. The jar-file of jgralab is located at jgralab/build/jar.
   It includes all necessary jar-files.
